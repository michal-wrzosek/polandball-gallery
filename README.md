# POLANDBALL APP for Growbots by Micha≈Ç Wrzosek

This is very basic app where there is still soooo much to do but I already spent couple of days on it and I'm starting to worry about deadline, so here it is :) I will for sure take care of proper tests and some UI/UX improvements later on.

To run vm:
`docker-compose up --build -d`
Then:
`docker-compose exec webpack bash`

To run webpack server, inside docker app:
`yarn run start`

To lint:
`yarn run lint`

To run tests:
`yarn run test`
